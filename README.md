# ZilJS

A web-based 'interpreter' for the Zork Implementation Language (ZIL), providing an Obsidian-like interface for streamlined playthroughs of Zork and other ZIL-based games. No Z-Machine to make it more interesting/almost certainly much more performant than most, if not all, current variations of this idea.
